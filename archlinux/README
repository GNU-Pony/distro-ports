Arch Linux ports, should work fine
all Pacman systems that is not all
too different from Arch Linux.


Excluded packages:

netcfg:
    Adopted from Arch Linux and is developed
    for both Arch Linux and GNU/Pony. The
    PKGBUILD is found in out git repository
    for netcfg.

filesystem (add extensions):
    Conflicts with and serves the same purpose
    as core/filesystem on Arch Linux, which is
    a part of the operating system.

licenses:
    Conflicts with and serves the same purpose
    as core/licenses on Arch Linux, which is
    an expected part of a system.

spike:
    Serves the same purpose as pacman and ABS,
    but does not work interchangeably, using
    Spike, or any other package management
    system then Pacman, on Arch Linux, or
    any other than the official package
    management system for any distribution,
    is strongly discouraged.


Other notes:

Scripts in miscellaneous has not yet been included.
